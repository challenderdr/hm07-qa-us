# Sprint 7 project

This porject was a task to test multiple endpoints for expected results.  Using VSCode to assist in writing tests to run. I used the Swagger docs to find the endpoints, and proper bodies for the requests.

In this project, I used VSCode to assist in writing test codes to test multiple endpoints.  To help with this I used Postman to verify what results should be expected.
To run the code I would put the proper command in the CMD program and the test results would be returned.
